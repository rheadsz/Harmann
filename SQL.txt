Primary key vs unique key
->table can have only 1 PK, but can have more than 1 unique key
->PK must not be null, UK can be null
->UK is used to avoid of dupliacte values in a table 
EX: custID: PK, AAdhar number: unique key (a cust may not have an aadhar)

super key: candidate key U other attributes
Super key is a single key or a group of multiple keys that can uniquely 
identify tuples in a table. Super Key can contain multiple attributes 
that might not be able to identify tuples in a table independently,
but when grouped with certain keys, they can identify tuples uniquely.

A candidate key SQL is a column or a set of columns that can qualify 
as a primary key in the database. There can be multiple SQL candidate 
keys in a database relation and each candidate can work as a primary key 
for the table.

if a set has n elements, we can have 2^n-1 subsets

Integrity constraints:
1)Entity integrity: constraint on the primary key
-> shldnt be null
-> shld be unique
-> every table must have  a PK
2)Domain integrity: a column/attrobute must have values from a specified
range (gives the columns a valid value)
3)user defined integrity: puts a constraint on the value in a col
ex: amazon will keep a constraint that a customer can purchase only
a certain number of items 
4)Referential integrity:
